#QA Automation â€” Cypress Tests
This project contains automated end-to-end tests built with Cypress for the website Automation Exercise.


WHAT I HAVE DONE:
Part 1

1.Automated user registration flow with dynamically generated user data using Faker.js.

2.Handled duplicate email registration with proper error message verification.

3.Verified user login status after registration by checking UI elements.

4.Managed user sessions and cookies to keep users logged in across tests.

5.Focused on writing reusable, modular, and maintainable test code.

6.Implemented error handling for validation messages on the website.

This project showcases my ability to create reliable automated tests for real-world web applications.
